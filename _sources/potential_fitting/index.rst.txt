Potential fitting
=====================

This section talks through one possible way to fit potentials for use with the ML-MIX plugin; using constrained linear regression to fit lightweight models to data generated by an expensive potential. We demonstrate this with atomic cluster expansion (ACE) and ultra-fast (UF3) potentials.
